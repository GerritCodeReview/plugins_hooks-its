      "message": "While I have have no strong opinion on how to capitalize abbreviations, I am somewhat averse to uppercase words. After all they refer to \"screaming\" according the netiquette. That makes abbreviations in all caps that are a proper English word a bad choice.\n\nSo, I\u0027d rather rather misread a plain sentence, than misread a sentence, that screams at me.\n\nEither way, I guess misreading ITS (That screams at me already :-) ) for the plain English word does not lead to a proper sentence for these occurrences.\n\nPatch Set 2 uses ITS.",
