[disabled|optional|required]\n\nAsking only ONCE would require less complexity on the code and less questions to the users.\n\nIn a nutshell, my understanding is that we ask the user if the integration should be:\n- Enabled (but not enforced)\n- Enabled and enforced\n- Disabled\n\nIs my understanding correct ?",
